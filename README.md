## Outline of Basic Tasks

1. **Set up the development environment**
   - Create a new Spring Boot project for the backend.
   - Set up a Vue.js project using the Vue CLI for the frontend.
   - Initialize a Git repository and create a README file.

2. **Design the database schema and establish the connection to the database**

3. **Backend Development (Spring Boot)**
   - Implement user registration and authentication, including validation and error handling.
   - Create RESTful API endpoints for user profiles, friend requests, posts, comments, and reactions.
   - Implement location-based features for discovering nearby trails and user recommendations.
   - Set up file storage for handling user-uploaded images and videos (e.g., local storage, Amazon S3).

4. **Frontend Development (Vue.js)**
   - Develop the user interface using Vue.js, including components for registration, login, user profiles, friend requests, posts, comments, and reactions.
   - Create components for displaying nearby trails, user recommendations, and trail details.
   - Integrate the frontend with the backend RESTful API, handling communication, data fetching, and updates.
   - Implement responsive design to ensure the app works well on various devices and screen sizes.

5. **Testing and optimization**
   - Write unit tests for backend API endpoints and frontend components.
   - Perform end-to-end testing to ensure the app works as expected.
   - Optimize the app for performance, security, and scalability.

6. **Deployment**
   - Deploy the Spring Boot backend to a server (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean).
   - Deploy the Vue.js frontend to a hosting provider (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, or Firebase Hosting).
